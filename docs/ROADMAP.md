# ROADMAP — Get PolyMesh off the ground

Master execution plan. **PROGRESS.md** tracks what is done; this file is the
target DAG. Phases map to `docs/phases.md` but GUI is pulled forward (ADR-0006).

## Agent loop protocol (how to finish this)

Every autonomous session follows:

```
1. PLAN   — pick highest-priority unblocked epic from below; write prediction
2. BUILD  — one epic slice (or one vertical user story), tests alongside
3. VERIFY — cmake --build build -j && ctest --test-dir build
            for GUI: also smoke polymesh-gui with a fixture if DISPLAY is set
4. COMMIT — Hunter-124 only, no AI attribution; push master
5. UPDATE — mark todos + PROGRESS.md Done line; if stuck 3× → write blocker
```

Hard rules (CLAUDE.md): patch test sacred, no hardcoded refs in product code,
double only, green suite before push.

**Do not** start GATE-declared phases out of order for frozen baselines.
GUI + mesh/adapt product work may advance in parallel with P2–P5 as long as
GATE 1 solver files stay untouched.

### Parallel tracks

| Track | Goal | Blocks ship? |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **A GUI** | Usable desktop study app | Yes — owner priority |
| **B Mesh** | Credible volume mesh from STL/STEP | Yes |
| **C Hybrid** | Conforming hex/tet/pyramid/VEM | Yes for “hybrid” claim |
| **D Adapt** | Solve → estimate → remesh loop that wins DOFs | Yes for SPEC goals |
| **E Verify** | Competitive benches + e2e on our mesh | Yes for honesty |
| **F Perf** | Threads / AMG / CUDA | No for first usable ship |
| **G Release** | Docs, examples, OSS packaging | End |

## Track A — GUI (P6.5 pulled forward)

**Exit:** Owner can open a part, assign fixtures/loads, mesh, solve, see stress
and error, export VTU — without CLI.

| ID | Task | Acceptance |
|----|------|------------|
| A1 | CLI argv: `polymesh-gui [path.stl\|.step]` | Opens model on launch |
| A2 | **Mesh preview** (no solve): Mesh button → boundary quads + element-type colors | Visible before solve |
| A3 | Failed-job UX: clear status, re-enable Solve | Can recover after failure |
| A4 | ZZ error field display mode (η per node or cell) | Third results mode works |
| A5 | Heatmap colorbar + units in viewport | Legend always readable |
| A6 | Wireframe / undeformed overlay toggle | Can see mesh edges |
| A7 | Native file dialog or drag-drop (platform) | Open without typing path |
| A8 | Mesh note + DOF count in UI during/after mesh | Status not empty |
| A9 | Theme polish vs CAD reference (screenshots) | Owner sign-off ⛔ GATE 6.5 |
| A10 | Headless GUI pipeline tests for mesh-only path | ctest covers mesh preview data |

## Track B — Mesh quality (P2 remaining)

| D6 | ~~Tier-3: ≥5× DOF, ≥3× time vs uniform tet10 baseline~~ | Done — L-domain instrument: **5.12× DOF**, **12.2× time** (graded tet10 geometric vs uniform n6; scoreboard `d6-tier3`) |

## Track E — Verification / competitive

| ID | Task | Acceptance |
|----|------|------------|
| E1 | ~~CalculiX cantilever peer runner green when `ccx` present~~ | Done (`run_calculix_cantilever.py`; skip exit 0 if no ccx) |
